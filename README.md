Hi! Here, you can find a packet capture and a server software related to our fictional ALIS protocol.

The txt files are just tshark outputs and contains same payload data with the ALIS_capture.pcapng file. In the lua directory, Wireshark plugins can be found.

ALIS_analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook file and contains some useful Python code.
